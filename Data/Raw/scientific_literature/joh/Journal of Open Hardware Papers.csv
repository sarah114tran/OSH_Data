Here we describe a 3D-printed precise treat dispenser with a 59-treat capacity driven by a stepper motor drive and controlled by an integrated Raspberry Pi. The dispenser can be built for less than 200 USD and is fully 3D printable. While off-the-shelf dispensers can result in an error rate of 20–30%, the precision dispenser produces a 4% error rate.

The open source multichannel pipette is found to be compliant with ISO 8655 standards for precision and accuracy. The device has separate syringes that operate individual tips, which prevents cross contamination of specimens because there is no direct contact of different liquids with each other and no mixing with actuating air.

However, with advent of microelectronics, embedded systems and field programmable gate arrays, geophysical instruments have largely become a black box for most users: experiments are limited by the budgets that are available rather than the imagination of the geoscientific community. The solution we propose is to introduce affordable, modular and lightweight multi-component seismic instruments that can be deployed easily by researchers and explorers alike. We have developed a system that allows seismic data acquisition using very sensitive and compact accelerometers. These sensors are coupled to high-speed, multi-channel 24-bit downhole acquisition modules that were developed for this project. The control and synchronization of the system is engineered around microcontrollers that are compatible with the Arduino ecosystem. Communication between the parts of the system is done via a novel frequency modulated RS-485 communication protocol. This protocol makes it possible to send power and data over a wireline with only two conductors. The small diameter and the low cost of this system facilitates the deployment of a large number of channels or in configurations that may not be feasible with commercial equipment. The modular nature of the system makes it easy to adapt to other downhole applications or for draggable sensor arrays on surface. We consider that these efforts will contribute to the democratization of seismic survey in exploration, civil engineering and water prospecting to help reduce the global environmental impacts of human activities.","2023-02-15","2025-03-19 19:19:08","2025-03-19 19:19:08","2025-03-19 19:19:08","3","","1","7","","","Geophysical Open Seismic Hardware","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/saraht45/Zotero/storage/HBRMRFMH/Mercier et al. - 2023 - Geophysical Open Seismic Hardware Design of a Vertical Seismic Profiling Instrument.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hardware and software build instructions are provided to convert the donor vehicle into a low-cost and fully autonomous platform. The open platform consists of (a) hardware components: CAD designs, bill of materials, and build instructions; (b) Arduino, ROS and Gazebo control and simulation software files which provide standard ROS interfaces and simulation of the vehicle; and (c) higher-level ROS software implementations and configurations of standard robot autonomous planning and control, including the move_base interface with Timed-Elastic-Band planner which enacts commands to drive the vehicle from a current to a desired pose around obstacles. The vehicle is large enough to transport a human passenger or similar load at speeds up to 15 km/h, for example for use as a last-mile autonomous taxi service or to transport delivery containers similarly around a city center. It is small and safe enough to be parked in a standard research lab and be used for realistic human-vehicle interaction studies. System build cost from new components is around USD7,000 in total in 2022.

Electroporation is an effective and efficient method for delivering plasmid DNA into D. discoideum, an invaluable tool for studying intracellular processes. The technology is readily available but often prohibitively expensive. Although several custom-built electroporation devices have been developed, none deliver the specific 8.5kV/cm exponentially decaying waveform required for D. discoideum transformation. The present study examined whether a simple, inexpensive device can be built to produce this waveform through a simple resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit. A pulse generator RC circuit was built incorporating inexpensive electronic components and a 3D printed cuvette chamber. All four possible combinations of custom-built and commercial pulse generators and custom-built and commercial cuvette chambers were used to transform D. discoideum cells with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). There were no significant differences in the number of surviving cells immediately following or 24 hours post-transformation between the systems. All combinations of custom-built and commercial systems achieved comparably high transformation efficiency shown by percent of cells expressing GFP six days after the transformation. Since the waveform-specific electroporation system we present here can be built by non-experts with easily obtainable materials and 3D printing, we envision this device to benefit investigators in areas with low research budgets and educators in multiple STEM fields.","2023-05-08","2025-03-19 19:20:31","2025-03-19 19:20:31","2025-03-19 19:20:31","5","","1","7","","JOH","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/saraht45/Zotero/storage/6I6NJRNI/Cauchy et al. - 2023 - A Low-Cost Electroporator for Genetically Modifying Social Amoeba Dictyostelium Discoideum.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most audio-tactile systems developed in research or commercially available today focus on converting existing music into vibrations. Consequently, vibrotactile music composition (creating music specifically for the body through vibrations) remains largely underexplored. The author argues that this discipline could encourage more equal interaction and sharing of the musical experience between deaf and hearing individuals and in this paper, a multichannel, vibrotactile speaker designed to achieve this goal is presented. It reproduces analog audio signals from a standard electro-acoustic chain (source, audio interface, amplifier) and can be constructed for a cost of approximately 200 to 600 €, depending on access to a large-format 3D printer.","2024-10-11","2025-03-19 19:21:07","2025-03-19 19:21:07","2025-03-19 19:21:07","","","","","","","","","","","","Zenodo","","en","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","","","/Users/saraht45/Zotero/storage/TUYKHG7I/Briceno - 2024 - A multi-channel vibrotactile speaker system for a more equally shared musical experience between dea.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, increased data redundancy is expected to contribute to higher reliability and reproducibility of communicated results. One current limitation for further deployment, especially in open hardware solutions, is the integration of centrifuges in automated workflows. Conventional centrifuges are unsuitable for modular applications and, crucially, do not offer the required positional control over the samples. This work presents a centrifuge with infrared sensor-derived positional control based on open-source design and cost-effective manufacturing, which is a prototype for integrated operation. Building with modular components, this centrifuge allows further customized adaptations with controlling from the serial port. This work presents the design, construction, validation, functionality testing, and quality control for operation. Besides, the smart centrifuge is compatible with various deck configurations due to an adaptive design, here demonstrated for the pipetting robot OT-2 (Opentrons). This accessible platform offers flexible use in automated synthesis and sample processing in various fields including life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering.","2024-10-16","2025-03-19 19:21:16","2025-03-19 19:21:16","2025-03-19 19:21:16","","","","","","","","","","","","Zenodo","","en","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","","","/Users/saraht45/Zotero/storage/NTP6IMJT/Gao et al. - 2024 - A Smart Centrifuge for Automated Sample Processing with Liquid Handling Robots.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
