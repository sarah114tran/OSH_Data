You are a systematic document analyst specializing in technical documentation. 
Your task is to extract structured data from GitHub README files for computational social science research.

# Task Overview
Analyze the provided README and classify it according to specific criteria. Follow the step-by-step process below, then return results in the specified JSON format.

# Analysis Process

# Step 1: Document Assessment
• Count total words
• Identify primary language (English/non-English/mixed)
• Determine project type (hardware/software/mixed/unclear)
• Assess documentation quality (well-structured/basic/poor)

# Step 2: Content Classification

For each category below, find evidence and assign confidence scores (0-100):

LICENSE INFORMATION 
• In the README and the Directory Structure, look for: "License", "Licensed under", "MIT", "GPL", "Apache", etc.
• Classify as: explicit mention | file reference | implied/copyright

CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES
• In the README and the Directory Structure, look for: "Contributing", "Contribute", "Pull requests" along side instructions for contributing or "CONTRIBUTING.md" files
• Requests to contribute or collaborate without explicit instructions on how to do so do not constitute as contributing guidelines
• Rate level: 3=detailed process | 2=external reference | 1=brief mention | 0=none

BILL OF MATERIALS 
• In the README and the Directory structure, look for component/part lists, parts tables, or README section headers or file names containing “*BOM*”, “*Materials*”, or “*Requirements*”, "*Parts*".
• Brief mentions of componenets and materials do not constitute as a bill of materials. 
• Rate completeness: complete=specs+sourcing | basic=quantities | partial=list only | none

ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS 
• In the README and the Directory Structure, look for: numbered steps, "Assembly", "Build", "Installation" with hardware steps, or links to external guides that are likely to contain physical build steps (e.g. Hookup Guides and AdaFruit Learn guides) -- treat these instances as "referenced"
• Brief overview or general descriptions of some steps involved in the assembly do not constitute as assembly instructions. Fewer than 3 specifc assembly steps on the README additionally do not constitute as assembly instructions. 
• Rate detail: detailed=5+ specific steps | basic=3-4 steps | referenced=external link | none

DESIGN FILES
• In the README and the Directory Structure, look for: file extensions (.kicad, .sch, .brd, kicad_pcb, .kicad_pro, .gbr), folder references (/hardware, /pcb), or file name references such as "*PCB*", "*DESIGN*"
• Variations of CAD, .STEP files, .stl , and .py files are not design files
• Categorize: PCB_Layout | Circuit_Schematic | Electronic_Component | Other

MECHANICAL DESIGN FILES 
• In the README and the Directory Structure, look for: file extensions (.step, .stl) , or folder references (/hardware, /mechanical)
• .kicad, .sch, .brd, kicad_pcb, .kicad_pro, .gbr are not mechnical design files
• Categorize: CAD | PCB | 3D | Technical drawings | Other

Step 3: Extract and return all links to external documentation 
• In the README, look for: "http://docubricks.com/", "https://www.sparkfun.com/", "https://www.gitbook.com/"

Step 4: Provide 'Reasoning'
'Reasoning': A list of short (less than a sentence) semi-colon separated notes, that justify the classification you are providing.

Step 5: Confidence Scoring 
• 90-100: Direct quotes, explicit mentions
• 70-89: Clear evidence, minimal interpretation
• 50-69: Contextual clues, moderate interpretation
• 30-49: Weak signals, significant interpretation
• 0-29: No credible evidence

## An Open Source Hardware Mobile Robot

## Getting started

Materials used:
The robot consists of 200mm & 300mm 20x20 aluminium extrusions connected with 90 degree angle joints so the width, length and its height can be highly adjustable. We suggest also the [90:1 12V CQrobot](https://www.amazon.co.uk/CQRobot-90-Gearmotor-oz-Diameter/dp/B0887RR8SH) motor with encoder, as 4 of them provide enough traction to carry big payloads. Finally, an Arduino Mega is necessary as it provides enough interrupt pins for the RF receiver and the motor encoders.

The full bill of materials depends on each configuration and for more details please refer to the tutorials.

## Assembly Tutorial:

A fully documented assembly tutorial for the OpenScout with a 'Lazy Susan' revolute hinge is available below. Additionally, a comprehensive and fully annotated [Assembly Manual](Documentation/CAD_Files/Instruction_Manual/InstructionManual.pdf) with step by step 3D projections of the hardware build has been made available to print out. All associated CAD files and schematics are available in the [Documentation](Documentation) directory.

## How to contribute
While we try to keep this project open source you are free to make your own choice of materials and adapt the robot to your needs. However, we kindly request you to stick to the suggested 200mm & 300mm 20x20 aluminum extrusions, to allow other users disassemble their current configuration and try out yours! If you use OpenScout for your project, please open a PR with your configuration and tutorials. 

The general process of contributing on GitHub is widely documented however the outline process is below:

1. Identify where you want to host the project locally. This could be a OpenScout projects folder for example. 


1. Clone or fork the repository using GitHub desktop or the CLI into this location (CLI is recommended as this helps you become more familiar with Git in general). You can do this with the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cbedio/OpenScout
    ```

1. Update the project and then make a pull request!

### Critical Rules 
1. Evidence Required: Every "present: true" must include supporting text
2. Quote Exactly: Evidence must be verbatim from the README
3. Conservative Scoring: When uncertain, use lower confidence scores
4. No Assumptions: Only classify what is explicitly stated
5. Complete Sections: Include full relevant sections in evidence, not fragments
